<strong>Security</strong>
<p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.</p>

<br><strong>How We Use Your Face Data</strong>
<p>We do not collect or permanently store any identifiable face data from users. The Party Planner app allows users to upload personal photos to generate AI-powered content in various styles such as cartoons, portraits, hairstyles, characters, or fictional avatars. When a photo is submitted, the facial data is encrypted and sent securely to our servers for real-time visual processing. This data is not linked to user accounts or identities. After the processing is complete, both the image and any associated face data are automatically deleted within 7 days. We do not use facial recognition, we do not track users across sessions, and we do not share or sell face data to any third party.</p>
